How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

i think the best way to write the program with those qualities is by  considering every use case or intention that I have with a program like for example who are the users as well ensuring is understandable so users dont have any issues while using the file. i think a advantage for the CRUD module was that it was extensible for all the modules so i could use them over and over.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? 

the best way i think i can approach a problem as a computer scientist is by being really methodical understanding amd ensuring i read the matrial requirements going over andover to ensure things are almost perfect and looking for help with peers around me if im unsure. i as well think it would be a great add on that i use different methods for my future client database.

What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

in my understanding computer scientist develop computer base solutions as well they  maximize efficiencies in the work they do. i think it matters because computer scientist work is very important and necessary because it helps to process more data in the best prossible way. the way my work helped was by creating a project to assist companies like  Grazioso Salvare to help people and animals wich it help with rescue and etc
